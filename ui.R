We aim to unravel the complex relationship between social media usage and its effects on users' psychological well-being. In an era where social media platforms dominate our daily interactions and self-perception, with their emphasis on visually curated lives, social media like twitter or instagram stands out for their potential to influence mental health. This journey seeks to explore and visualize the nuanced ways in which continuous exposure to idealized images, the pursuit of likes, and the pressure to maintain a perfect online persona contribute to increased feelings of anxiety, depression, and loneliness among its users."),

The data was collected through the Kisii University College Faculty of Health Sciences. Online surveys and in campus data collection methods were used. John Ngugi analyzed the behaviors of participants and based it off of a self-report score and an actual score on their mental health from a different survey that would rank their actual well being to see if there were any biases that would cause people to say different."),

This dataset was collected through a Statistics course at a university, collecting data on the local campus and processed the information through a machine learning algorithm that was later used to create a predictive model to see if someone needs professional help or not. The survey has a bunch of different ways of actually narrowing down the symptoms that generate data which really homes in on the overall trend of social media use."),
